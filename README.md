# PartyParrot

## What is Gradle?

A gradle is a build automation tool or a package manager. 

GradleÂ is used for multi-language software development. 

It is used to add a third party dependency, that is not inbuilt in your language.

It downloads libraries as per your need and builds it in your application.
